# Corgi64: Simulated Computer 

Welcome! 

What if you had a computer that had the simplicity of the Commodore 64 with the power of more modern systems? What if you had a simulation of a cpu, monitor, keyboard and mouse controller, etc. that you could easily read through and modify to learn more about computers? What if the simulated computer was simple enough that individuals could take on other learning projects far more easily, like building their own operating system? 

That's the idea and purpose behind the Corgi64 project, to provide a simple, modular, and compact simulated computer system that allows people to learn more about computers. 

NOTE: This is a work in progress, it is not yet finished or fully functioning yet. Please look at the videos linked below to take a look at the progress.

I have a video series detailing my efforts writing Corgi64: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhO5W6y3BWc&list=PLSiFUSQSRYAND5ETcWAkiD5tBxM-kZGLD

## System Requirements
Because I wanted this system to be as simple as possible I've only targeted one type of system, Windows 10 on x64 processors. If you are programming savvy, feel free to port it to other systems. 

To compile Corgi64, you'll need the c++ compiler offered by Microsoft Visual Studio. You can acquire a free version here: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/

Alternatively, Corgi64 should be able to compile with gcc offered through MinGW or Cygwin.

## Compiling and Running 
To compile Corgi64, run the following command within the main directory:  
`build.bat`

To run Corgi64, run the following command:  
`bin\main.exe`
