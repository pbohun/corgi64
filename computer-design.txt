General Design 

-----------------------------------------
CPU
-----------------------------------------
The cpu will connect to memory.

-----------------------------------------
GRAPHICS/DISPLAY
-----------------------------------------
Connects to memory and simulates a monitor and also provides graphics acceleration.

-----------------------------------------
IO/DEVICES
-----------------------------------------
Connects to memory and deals with interface to io devices such as mouse, keyboard, controllers, printers, etc.
For implementation reasons, this will likely be tightly coupled with the graphics module.
